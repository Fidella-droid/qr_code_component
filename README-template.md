## Overview

This project is a simple HTML and CSS QR code component on a web page. The reason why I worked on this project was to practice the use of Flex and content sizing.

## My process

In developing this project, I followed a systematic approach to make my flow organized and efficient. I started by setting up the basic html skeleton by creating the necessary tags and structure to build my foundation and then I added content to my elements. After that, I  proceeded to bring the component to life by styling it with CSS. I added the styles, specifying color schemes, font, and layout setting based on the styles guide.My focus was on positioning the content as accurately as possible, aligning it closely with the design provided. I used flex to arrange the content of the component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got in-depth knowledge on Flexbox and content sizing principles.Through this learning process, I gained knowledge about the appropriate usage of pixel (px), root em (rem), and element em (em) units for sizing elements effectively.

### Continued development

I want to focus on media queries, particularly their role in achieving responsiveness, and gain comprehensive knowledge on their implementation and usage.
